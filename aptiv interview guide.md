### Sensor Fusion
Sensor fusion is the process of combining data from multiple sensors to create a comprehensive and accurate view of an environment. In automotive applications, sensor fusion typically involves integrating data from:
   - **Cameras**: Provide visual data to identify objects, lanes, and traffic signs.
   - **Radar**: Measures distance and speed of objects, useful in all weather conditions.
   - **Lidar** (in some systems): Offers precise 3D mapping and object detection.
   - **Ultrasonic Sensors**: Detects objects at close range, helpful for parking and low-speed maneuvers.

By merging these different data sources, sensor fusion allows an autonomous or semi-autonomous vehicle to achieve:
   - **Improved Accuracy**: Combines strengths of different sensors, reducing errors.
   - **Increased Reliability**: Provides redundancy, so if one sensor fails, others can compensate.
   - **Enhanced Decision-Making**: Allows the vehicle to understand its surroundings in greater detail, enabling better navigation, obstacle avoidance, and emergency responses.

### Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS)
ADAS are systems that assist drivers in operating a vehicle safely and efficiently. They range from basic features like cruise control to more advanced functionalities that can control the vehicle autonomously in certain situations.

Some common ADAS features include:
   - **Lane Keeping Assist (LKA)**: Helps keep the car centered within its lane, with alerts or automatic steering corrections.
   - **Automatic Emergency Braking (AEB)**: Detects potential collisions and applies brakes automatically if necessary.
   - **Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC)**: Adjusts the vehicle’s speed to maintain a safe following distance from the car ahead.
   - **Blind Spot Detection**: Alerts the driver to vehicles in their blind spots, enhancing situational awareness.

These systems use sensor fusion to gather and process information from multiple sensors, enabling the vehicle to make informed decisions that improve safety and reduce the driver’s workload. ADAS features serve as foundational technologies for fully autonomous vehicles, as they provide crucial data and control mechanisms needed for self-driving capabilities.
